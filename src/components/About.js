          Originally from Lisbon, my professional journey began at Young &
          Rubicam Portugal, where I worked on illustration, storyboarding, and
          post-production projects. It was during this time that my passion for
          pixel-perfect work, screen design and the way ideas can be
          communicated in the digital world began. Since then, I‚Äôve been working
          as a full-time digital designer while pursuing illustration projects
          on the side. My passion to solve problems and create visually
          captivating work led me on a journey around the world. ‚Äôm fortunate to
          work in a team where we collaborate openly, strive for excellence and
          craft meaningful digital experiences that impacts people‚Äôs lives.
